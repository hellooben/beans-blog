# Some Info About Me

<div id="profile-pic"></div><br>

-------

I'm a 19 year old from Knoxville, Tennessee. I attend the University of Alabama where I'm studying for a BS in Computer Science in a program that lets me pursue an MBA at the same time. I'm currently an intern for Right Click Design, a software development company in Knoxville. I have been doing mostly web design and development, some business development, and a whole lot of learning.
