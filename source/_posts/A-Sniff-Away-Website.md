I built this website for a client who is starting a nonprofit organization for dogs that can detect cancer. Pretty cool!

The site is my first website in WordPress, which I chose so that the client would be able to make small changes without having to go through me. After finishing this project, I have come to the conclusion that I definitely prefer working with custom HTML and CSS because of the freedom it provides. However, this project was fun and I think it turned out well!
