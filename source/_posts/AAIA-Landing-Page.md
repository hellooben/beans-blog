The first real project of my summer internship was this landing page, with additional info pages, for the Appalachian Angel Investor Alliance.

The project was built with a landing page template pulled from [elements.envato.com](https://elements.envato.com/web-templates/landing-page-templates/). From there, custom HTMl, CSS, and Javascript was applied to perfection. Apart from some small pieces of copy that I'm still waiting on from the client, the site is finished! Have a look by clicking on the photo above.
